# üñ•Ô∏è Microprocessor Design

Welcome to my microprocessor design project repository! This repository contains various components of my journey towards creating a fully functional microprocessor. By the end of this summer, I aim to design and implement single cycle, multi-cycle, and pipelined processors, and program an FPGA chip using VHDL. This is a personal project and none of the work here is related to academic assignments.

## üéØ Project Goals

1. **Single Cycle Processor**: Design and implement a single cycle processor.
2. **Multi-Cycle Processor**: Extend the design to a multi-cycle processor.
3. **Pipelined Processor**: Develop a pipelined processor to improve performance.
4. **FPGA Programming**: Program the designed processors on an FPGA using VHDL.

## üöÄ Current Progress
1. Writing testbench for multi-cycle microprocessor

### üîç Sequence Detector

In the `Practicing the Basics` folder, I have implemented basic circuits such as a CLA and a sequence detector, using basic digital design techniques such as Karnaugh map simplification and Moore and Mealy state machines. A formal write-up will be added soon, but for now, it's just my calculations and notes on paper.

- **Karnaugh Map Simplification**: Used for minimizing Boolean expressions.
- **Moore and Mealy State Machines**: Implemented both types of state machines for the sequence detector.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `SingleCycleProcessor/`: Contains the design and implementation of the single cycle processor.
- `MultiCycleProcessor/`: Work in progress for the multi-cycle processor.
- `PipelinedProcessor/`: Work in progress for the pipelined processor.
- `PracticingTheBasics/`: Contains basic digital design projects, including the sequence detector.

## üìÖ Future Plans

- Write formal documentation and explanations for each design.
- Test the processors on an FPGA and optimize the VHDL code.
- Continuously update the repository with new digital design projects and learning experiences.
